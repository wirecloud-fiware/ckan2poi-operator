# CKAN 2 POI operator

This operator transforms data from a CKAN source to Points of Interest. To be able to do so, the dataset should provide a column containing the coordinates for each row or, alternatively, two columns, one with the latitude an another one with the longitude. Also, take into account the fact this operator is generic, so marker bubbles of the PoIs created by this operator will be a mere composition of the attribute/value pairs.


## Build dependencies

Be sure to have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) in your system. For example, you can install it on Ubuntu and Debian running the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update; sudo apt install curl gnupg
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

You also have to install the [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)'s command line interface (CLI):

```sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

The remaining dependencies are installed using npm (you have to run this command
inside the folder where you downloaded this repository):

```bash
npm install
```


## Build

Once installed all the build dependencies you can build this operator by using grunt:

```bash
grunt
```

If everything goes well, you will find a wgt file in the `dist` folder.
