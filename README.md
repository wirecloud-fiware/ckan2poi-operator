# CKAN 2 POI operator

This operator transforms data from a CKAN source to Points of Interest. To be able to do so, the dataset should provide a column containing the coordinates for each row or, alternatively, two columns, one with the latitude an another one with the longitude. Also, take into account the fact this operator is generic, so marker bubbles of the PoIs created by this operator will be a mere composition of the attribute/value pairs.

## Build

Be sure to have installed [Node.js](http://node.js) and [Bower](http://bower.io) in your system. For example, you can install it on Ubuntu and Debian running the following commands:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install -g bower
```

Install other npm dependencies by running: (need root because some libraries use applications, check package.json before to be sure)

```bash
sudo npm install
```

In order to build this widget you need to download grunt:

```bash
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

And now, you can use grunt:

```bash
grunt
```

If everything goes well, you will find a wgt file in the `dist` folder.
